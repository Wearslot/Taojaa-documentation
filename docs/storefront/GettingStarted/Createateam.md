## Taojaa Themes 

        <p style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
        Themes in Taojaa are initialized using a predefined skeleton known as "affluent." This affluent skeleton serves as a comprehensive template that provides a structured and consistent foundation for theme development. It includes essential components, layout configurations, and design elements, ensuring that themes maintain a cohesive and visually appealing appearance. By using the affluent skeleton, developers can streamline the theme creation process, focusing on customization and unique features while adhering to a well-defined and tested framework.
